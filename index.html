            <p>Utah is a beautiful place to live. Along with the conveniences of big cities, there are mountains, trees, and lakes. I live close to Antelope Island, which is located on the Great Salt Lake. There is a causeway that you have to drive on to get to Antelope Island. This photo is from that causeway.</p>
